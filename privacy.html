    Game: <strong>LA5</strong> · Developer: <strong>BabbyGames</strong><br />
    Contact: <a href="mailto:babbygames17@gmail.com">babbygames17@gmail.com</a><br />
    Last updated: <strong>5 December 2025</strong>
  </div>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>BabbyGames</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) handles information when you use the mobile game <strong>LA5</strong> (“the Game”). By installing or playing LA5, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We do not ask you to create a separate BabbyGames account, and we do not request your real name, postal address, or phone number inside the Game. However, some information is collected when you use LA5, either by us directly or by third-party services we integrate.
  </p>

  <h3>1.1 Information you provide to us</h3>
  <p>
    If you contact us by email or through a support form, we receive your email address and any information you include in your message.  
    If you voluntarily share screenshots, crash reports, or other details, we will use that information only to answer your request or fix issues.
  </p>

  <h3>1.2 Information collected automatically</h3>
  <p>When you play LA5, the Game and the third-party services it uses may automatically collect:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Device and app information (device model, operating system version, language, app version, performance and crash data).</li>
    <li>Online identifiers (platform account IDs, device identifiers, advertising IDs, and similar IDs used by platforms and SDKs).</li>
    <li>Approximate location such as country or region, typically inferred from IP address or store region.</li>
    <li>Gameplay data such as modes played, time spent in each mode or menu, match results, unlocks, and in-game settings.</li>
    <li>Purchase information related to in-app purchases (such as product ID and purchase status, but not full payment card details).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We treat this information as personal data where it can be linked or reasonably linked to an individual device or player.</p>

  <h2>2. Third-party services we use</h2>
  <p>
    LA5 uses third-party services to provide features such as login, multiplayer, cloud saves, analytics, advertising, crash reporting, and payments. These providers process data in accordance with their own terms and privacy policies. We do not sell your data.
  </p>

  <h3>2.1 Online services (login, multiplayer, cloud saves)</h3>
  <p>
    We use online service providers to enable player authentication, multiplayer features, and cloud saving of your game progress. These services may process identifiers (such as platform or service IDs), device information, and gameplay data needed to operate these online features and to prevent cheating or abuse.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Epic Online Services (EOS)</strong> – used for features such as login and cloud saves.
    <br>https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 Analytics and crash reporting</h3>
  <p>
    We may use analytics tools to understand how LA5 is used, which game modes are popular, how long sessions last, and where technical issues occur. Analytics services collect usage events, device data, and crash information and provide us with aggregated or pseudonymous reports. We use these reports to improve balance, performance, and stability.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Firebase Analytics / Crashlytics (Google LLC)</strong> – collects app usage information, device details, performance metrics, and crash logs.  
    <br>Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy
  </p>

  <h3>2.3 Advertising</h3>
  <p>
    LA5 may display ads provided by third-party advertising networks. These partners may collect and use information such as your advertising ID, device information, approximate location, and interactions with ads in order to show, personalize, and measure advertisements.
  </p>

  <p>
    Specific ad networks used may change over time. Each network processes data under its own privacy policy. You can typically limit personalized ads through your device settings (for example, “Opt out of Ads Personalization” on Android).
  </p>

  <h3>2.4 In-app purchases (IAP) and platform providers</h3>
  <p>
    If you make an in-app purchase, the payment is processed by the platform store (such as Google Play). We receive purchase-related information such as the product ID, purchase token, and status so that we can grant the in-game item, but we do not receive your full payment card number or bank account details.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>3. How we use information</h2>
  <p>We use the information described above to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Operate LA5 and provide core gameplay and online features such as login, matchmaking, multiplayer, and cloud saves.</li>
    <li>Process in-app purchases and deliver purchased content.</li>
    <li>Show, cap, and measure ads where ads are enabled.</li>
    <li>Analyze gameplay and technical performance to balance the game, improve content, and fix bugs or crashes.</li>
    <li>Prevent cheating, abuse, or security incidents in online features.</li>
    <li>Respond to player support requests and enforce our Terms & Conditions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. How information is shared</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell or rent your personal data. We share information only in these situations:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>With the third-party service providers described above, so they can provide login, cloud saves, analytics, ads, crash reporting, and payments for LA5.</li>
    <li>With platform providers that distribute the Game and process purchases.</li>
    <li>With competent authorities or other parties when required by law, to protect our rights, or to protect players from fraud, abuse, or security threats.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    Gameplay data and cloud saves are kept for as long as your account or device is actively using LA5 and its online features, or as needed to operate and secure the service.
  </p>

  <p>
    Analytics and log data may be kept for a limited period (for example, for several months or years) as determined by each analytics or platform provider, after which it may be deleted or aggregated.
  </p>

  <p>
    Support emails are kept for as long as needed to handle your request and for a reasonable period afterward for records and to prevent abuse.
  </p>

  <p>Where possible, data may be aggregated or anonymized so it no longer identifies a specific player.</p>

  <h2>6. Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>
    LA5 is not intended for children under 13, or a higher age where required by local law. We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information through LA5, please contact us and we will take appropriate steps to remove it.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Your choices and rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your device and region, you may be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Adjust device or platform privacy settings to limit analytics, personalized ads, or certain permissions.</li>
    <li>Use platform privacy tools to access, delete, or limit data held by those platforms.</li>
    <li>Uninstall LA5 to stop all future data collection through the Game on that device.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can also contact us at <a href="mailto:babbygames17@gmail.com">babbygames17@gmail.com</a> with privacy questions about LA5.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top shows the latest version. If we make material changes, we will take reasonable steps to let you know (for example, by updating the policy on our website). Continued use of LA5 after an update means you accept the revised policy.
